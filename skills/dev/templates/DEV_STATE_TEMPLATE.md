# /dev Recovery Log

The Tech Lead is the sole writer of this file. Append a timestamped entry after every verified transition. Do not let workers edit the ledger.

## Execution record schema

Each `execution` entry records: `execution_backend`, `detection_status`, `detection_reason`, `backend_source`, `topology`, `skill_dir`, `traycer_agent_id`, and `traycer_epic_id`.

`skill_dir` is the absolute path `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` resolved to at dispatch time. Dispatched agents do not inherit `CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR`, so the lead substitutes this path into worker, QA, and reviewer prompts before sending them. Re-resolve it at the start of each run rather than trusting a stored value: the path changes when the Skill is reinstalled, and it is version-stamped when the Skill is installed as a plugin.

Allowed `backend_source` values: `null` (not yet resolved), `detected` (the detector chose the backend), and `lead_resolved` (the lead overrode an `incomplete` result, e.g. `claude-native`).

## Worker record schema

Each `workers` entry records: `role`, `issue`, `agent_id`, `harness`, `model`, `profile`, `profile_source`, `reasoning_effort`, `permission_mode`, `route_source`, `branch`, `base_oid`, `source_workspace`, `worktree`, `ownership`, `status`, `pr`, `communication_response_id`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`.

Allowed status values: `planned`, `worktree_ready`, `active`, `blocked`, `pr_created`, `qa`, `review`, `complete`, `stopped`.

## Pull request record schema

Each `pull_requests` entry records: `number`, `issue`, `branch`, `headRefOid`, `qa_status`, `qa_agent_id`, `internal_review_status`, `reviewer_agent_id`, `external_review_state`, `expected_reviewers`, `requested_reviewers`, `observed_reviewers`, `pending_reviewers`, `completed_reviewers`, `external_findings`, `unresolved_actionable_findings`, `review_deadline`, `wait_extensions`, `approved_review_requests`, `approved_bypasses`, `review_debt`, `required_checks`, `blockers`, `updated_at`, and `next_action`.

Accepted reviews apply only to the recorded `headRefOid`. After any push, reset QA, internal review, and external-review completion to pending for the new head.
