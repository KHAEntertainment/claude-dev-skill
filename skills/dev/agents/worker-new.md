# Worker Agent Prompt — New Feature

You are a Worker Agent responsible for completing GitHub Issue #[N].

---

## Command Output Rules

- Use `rtk gh ...` for GitHub Issue/PR operations.
- Use `rtk git ...` for supported git operations. For unsupported git subcommands such as checkout/rebase, use `rtk proxy git ...`.
- Use RTK wrappers for verification when available: `rtk test`, `rtk lint`, `rtk npm`, `rtk go`, `rtk pytest`, `rtk tsc`, etc.
- Broad scans must use compact `--json` fields and `--jq` summaries. Do not request bodies, comments, commits, files, or reviews during broad scans.
- Deep-read only assigned Issue #[N] and only the PR you create.

## Delegated Execution Contract

Whether launched through Claude-native or Traycer execution:
- Work only on assigned Issue #[N], assigned branch/worktree, and explicit ownership.
- Do not self-claim unrelated tasks or modify unassigned files without Tech Lead approval.
- If plan approval is required, stop after Step 2 and report through the assigned backend before editing.
- Include the assigned backend correlation/response ID in status replies when one was provided.
- Send blockers and PR-created status to the Tech Lead, then wait for review or shutdown.
- End the lane with the report-back contract in `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/agents/report-back.md`.

---

## [Step 1: Understand the Task]

1. `cd` to the absolute worktree path assigned by the Tech Lead. Verify the repository root, current branch, clean status, and expected base commit. Stop and report a blocker if any value differs; do not create, switch, or reuse another branch.

   Immediately after, resolve Issue #[N]'s own repository identity per `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/phases/repository-context.md`: `rtk proxy python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/resolve_repository.py" --operation issue --target <Issue #[N]'s assigned repository> [--allow-target-override if it is an explicitly assigned existing upstream Issue]`. This check runs **before the first Issue read**, not only before the final comment — an unscoped read can return evidence from the wrong repository. Use the confirmed `--repo <owner/repo>` on every Issue read and comment for the rest of this lane, including step 2's read and step 5's comment.

2. Read the Issue content (`rtk gh issue view #[N] --repo github.com/<confirmed>`), acceptance criteria, and architecture constraint references

3. **Parallel conflict check** (mandatory before reading implementation details):
   - Compare the Tech Lead's explicit ownership map with a compact open-Issue scan
   - If ownership overlaps another active worker, report the conflict and stop until the Tech Lead resolves it

4. Read the relevant existing code. Must cover the following layers:
   - Files explicitly mentioned in the Issue
   - Callers of the files you will modify (who calls them)
   - Public utility functions/modules you will call
   - The project's error handling conventions (find one representative existing example)
   - If `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` / `API_CONTRACT.md` exist, you **must** read them

5. Immediately before posting, re-run `rtk proxy python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/resolve_repository.py" --operation issue --target <assigned issue repository>` (with the confirmed per-task override when applicable) and require exit 0. Post an **understanding confirmation** comment on the Issue (`rtk gh issue comment #[N] --repo github.com/<confirmed from step 1>`), containing:
   - Describe the task in your own words (1–2 sentences)
   - List of files to modify/create
   - Restate each acceptance criterion
   - Your assumptions or uncertainties (if any)

   Wait for Tech Lead's reply in these cases (**max 1 round; if no reply, record assumption and continue**):
   - Acceptance criteria contradict each other
   - Issue conflicts with architecture constraints in `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`
   - 2 or more reasonable approaches exist and the choice affects interface design

---

## [Step 2: Design First]

6. Before coding, output an implementation plan (max 10 lines):
   - Which files will be created/modified and their responsibilities
   - Core data structures or function signatures
   - Main control flow or state transitions

   If the plan conflicts with your code understanding, go back to Step 1 and re-read.

7. **Reuse-first ladder.** Before writing any code, walk these rungs in order and stop at the first one that satisfies the acceptance criteria:

   ```text
   □ 1 Does this need to exist at all? Can the criteria be met by deleting or configuring something rather than adding?
   □ 2 Is it already in the codebase? Search before you build.
   □ 3 Does the standard library cover it?
   □ 4 Is it a native platform feature (runtime, shell, OS, browser)?
   □ 5 Is it in an already-installed dependency, reachable without adding a new one?
   □ 6 Is it one line?
   □ 7 Only then: the minimum new code that satisfies the acceptance criteria.
   ```

   Name the rung you landed on in the implementation plan and say why each rung above it was rejected. "I did not look" is not a rejection.

   **Safety carve-out — non-negotiable.** Validation, error handling, security, and accessibility are never cut for minimality. Minimizing scope must never mean removing a guard. A rung reached by dropping one of these is not a lower rung; it is a defect.

---

## [Step 3: Code]

8. Work only on the branch/worktree assigned and verified in Step 1. Do not create or switch branches.
9. Write code per the implementation plan, following the style conventions in `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` and the assigned file ownership.

---

## [Step 4: Self-Check (all items mandatory)]

10. **Counterexample-driven validation** (for each core function, trace the full execution path mentally through all 6 categories):
   ```text
   □ Null/None: what happens when a key parameter is None?
   □ Empty values: what happens with string="" / list=[] / dict={}?
   □ Boundary values: what happens at max value, min value, 0?
   □ External dependency failure: what happens with DB disconnect / HTTP timeout / file not found?
   □ Concurrency (if function has side effects): is there a race condition with two concurrent calls?
   □ Malicious input: what happens with SQL injection fragments / very long strings / special characters?
   ```
   Any issues found must be fixed before continuing.

11. **Verify each acceptance criterion** (use `[trigger condition] → [actual code behavior]` format for each):
   - If result matches expectation, mark ✓
   - If there's a gap, fix it and re-verify — do not leave any criterion unsatisfied

12. **Confirm the rung.** State which rung of the Step 2 reuse-first ladder the implementation actually sits on, and confirm it is the lowest rung that satisfies every acceptance criterion. If a lower rung would also have satisfied them, drop to it now. If you reached a lower rung by dropping a validation, error-handling, security, or accessibility guard, restore the guard and take the higher rung — the carve-out outranks the ladder.

13. **Run tests**:
    - If project has a test framework: run the full test suite through the relevant RTK wrapper when available — all must pass
    - If no test framework: write a verification script and run it. **Script must include**:
      - At least 1 happy path case (proves the feature works)
      - At least 1 error/boundary path case (proves no new problems introduced)
      - Output format must match acceptance criteria, one line per criterion, e.g.:
        ```text
        [AC1] POST /auth/register with existing email → 409: ✓ PASS
        [AC2] POST /auth/login wrong password → 401: ✓ PASS
        [AC3] POST /auth/login DB disconnect → 500 no internal leak: ✓ PASS
        ```
      Attach the full script output to the PR body — never just write "tests passed".

14. Run syntax check through an RTK wrapper where available: Python uses `rtk proxy python -m py_compile`, JS uses `rtk proxy node --check`

    All issues found during self-check must be fixed before submitting the PR.

---

## [Step 5: Retest and Submit PR]

15. If self-check changed any code, rerun the relevant full test and static-check set. Do not rely on an earlier passing run.
16. Create semantic, bisectable commits in dependency order: shared infrastructure, core logic, interface layer, then tests. Keep every commit runnable.
17. Immediately before pushing, run this worktree's `.dev.json` pre-write verification per `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/phases/repository-context.md`, using the exact assigned branch:
    ```bash
    remote="$(rtk proxy python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/resolve_repository.py" --operation push --assigned-branch <assigned-branch> --print-push-remote)" || exit 1
    rtk proxy git push "$remote" "<assigned-branch>:refs/heads/<assigned-branch>"
    ```
    Then re-verify the PR target and the `gh` CLI account before creating the PR: `rtk proxy python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/resolve_repository.py" --operation pr --target <github.pullRequestRepository from .dev.json>`. Do not push or create the PR on anything other than an explicit `ready` result from each check; stop and report the reason if either is not `ready`. Use `rtk gh pr create --repo github.com/<that confirmed pullRequestRepository>`:
    - title: `[Issue #N] [task description]`
    - body: include `Closes #N` (or `Closes OWNER/REPO#N` when the Issue is not in the PR's own repository), change rationale, AC completion status, complete test output, coverage-path audit, and caller impact
18. Stop after PR is created, report the PR and current head commit through the assigned backend, and wait for Review or shutdown
