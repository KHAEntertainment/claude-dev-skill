"""Resolve the canonical GitHub repository and account before a `/dev` write.

Read-only by construction (a bounded `git push --dry-run` is the one
exception, and it never advances a ref). This helper decides whether a real
push or GitHub mutation is safe to run, by loading `.dev.json` itself rather
than trusting whatever a caller happens to pass. When it cannot establish one
unambiguous, matching, verified identity it exits 2 so the caller pauses
before the write instead of letting `git`, `gh`, or an omitted argument pick
a target for it.

Three independent things are validated, and a caller must not conflate them:

- **Push-target identity** (`--operation push`): does the actual Git push
  destination — every one of its push URLs, and the named remote itself —
  match `.dev.json`'s `pushRepository`? Fetch URLs are context, never a
  destination. This also runs the branch/refspec check and a `--dry-run`
  push using the exact validated remote and refspec.
- **Operation-target identity** (`--operation pr` / `--operation issue`): does
  the *explicit* `--repo`/`--target` argument the caller is about to pass to
  `gh` match the confirmed value for this operation — `pullRequestRepository`
  for an ordinary PR, `pushRepository` for a plugin-created Issue, or an
  explicitly assigned existing Issue's own qualified identity (pass
  `--allow-target-override` for that last case)? This has nothing to do with
  git push URLs.
- **Transport/CLI account** (`--mode check-https-account` / `check-ssh-account`
  / `check-gh-account`): does the credential Git or the `gh` CLI will
  actually use match `.dev.json`'s `account`? Neither commit authorship, a
  URL username, nor `gh auth status` establishes this.

`--fixture` is a separate, lower-level path that exercises the pure push-
target decision function (`_decide_push_target` via `resolve_repository()`)
against a hand-written remotes/defaults JSON document, without loading
`.dev.json` or touching the filesystem beyond that one file. It exists for
unit-testing the decision logic in isolation and is not the production
entrypoint: every real caller uses the default (non-fixture) `--operation`
path below, which loads and requires a valid `.dev.json`.

The GitHub CLI's own repository default (`gh repo set-default`) is recorded
for the ledger but never blocks a resolution: every supported operation is
explicitly scoped, so an unrelated CLI default may legitimately disagree with
a correctly configured fork's operation target.
