# Customized Distribution Changelog

## custom-v1.1.0-upstream.3e87db0 — 2026-08-29

### Added

- Conditional external-review oversight for CodeRabbit, Kilo Code, and GitHub Copilot.
- Current-head review-thread normalization, trusted-review inference from five recent PRs, explicit finding dispositions, and incomplete-evidence fail-closed behavior.
- Per-project trusted/required/ignored reviewer policy, configurable wait duration, explicit paid-review approval, and recorded timeout bypass debt.
- Fixture-testable GitHub review inspector distributed with the Skill.

### Changed

- Run external review concurrently with internal QA/review, then reconcile it before the final rating.
- Invalidate stale external review after every new PR head commit.
- Clarify that in-process Agent Teams do not require tmux or iTerm.

## custom-v1.0.0-upstream.3e87db0 — 2026-08-26

### Added

- Canonical user-invoked personal Skill at `skills/dev/`.
- RTK-first command and compact-output policy.
- `.agent/dev-state.md` recovery contract.
- Agent Team versus single-worker selection.
- Lead-prepared worktree/branch verification and explicit file ownership.
- QA, security, performance, and test-review specialist lanes.
- English translations of upstream's Chinese-only Phase 3.5, Phase 4, QA, worker, bootstrap, and Phase 5 behavior.
- English-only staged installer with dry-run, custom targets, preflight validation, legacy backup/migration, rollback, and failure injection tests.
- Static Skill reference validator and isolated installer test suite.

### Changed
