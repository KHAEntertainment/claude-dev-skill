# Customized Distribution Changelog

## custom-v1.0.0-upstream.3e87db0 — 2026-08-26

### Added

- Canonical user-invoked personal Skill at `skills/dev/`.
- RTK-first command and compact-output policy.
- `.agent/dev-state.md` recovery contract.
- Agent Team versus single-worker selection.
- Lead-prepared worktree/branch verification and explicit file ownership.
- QA, security, performance, and test-review specialist lanes.
- English translations of upstream's Chinese-only Phase 3.5, Phase 4, QA, worker, bootstrap, and Phase 5 behavior.
- English-only staged installer with dry-run, custom targets, preflight validation, legacy backup/migration, rollback, and failure injection tests.
- Static Skill reference validator and isolated installer test suite.

### Changed

- Allow the lead to maintain tracked planning/context documents while preserving the prohibition on direct implementation/test edits.
- Adapt Chinese lightweight, review auto-fix, and debt-deletion behavior to worker-owned Issue/worktree/PR flows.
- Use current Agent Teams lifecycle language: graceful teammate shutdown followed by lead cleanup.
- Treat tmux/iTerm as optional split-pane dependencies, not Agent Teams prerequisites.
