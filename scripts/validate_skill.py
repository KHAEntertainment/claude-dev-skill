# The Execution Routing Policy section defers to the agent selection guide and
# exists to stay empty of routes. It is pinned structurally: the section must
# contain its approved content and nothing else, so any added line fails
# whatever words it uses.
#
# It is deliberately NOT a denylist of harness or model names. A denylist can
# only reject the names someone thought of — `traycer`, `cursor`, or a route
# phrased with no harness name at all ("all lanes use the lead route") walk
# straight through one. Enumeration over prose is unbounded, and this section
# is small and fixed, so the whole body is the guard.
#
# Whitespace is normalised before comparing, so reflowing or rewrapping the
# section is not a failure. Editing its wording IS a failure until this constant
# is updated in the same commit — that is the point: the section cannot change
# without the change being deliberate and reviewed.

    "The agent selection guide governs role routing. This file records only "
    "project-specific exceptions, and there are none. Do not restate the "
    "guide's model or harness choices here, even to agree with them: a route "
    "recorded in this section outranks the guide in the adapter's resolution "
    "order, so anything written here silently overrides newer policy, and a "
    "copy made today becomes a stale override the moment the guide changes. "
    "That is why this section stays empty. One constraint does belong here, "
    "because it is a property of this project rather than a routing "
    "preference: **the lead runs on the `claude` harness, because the lead is "
    "what invokes `/dev`.** Worker, QA, and reviewer assignments are "
    "provider-neutral and may run on whichever harness and model the "
    "selection guide selects for them."

# machine-specific leak once stored in this file, so the guard must not carry
# one. The segment class includes spaces and apostrophes because real account
# names do ("Jane Doe", "O'Connor"), on top of the usual word characters,
# dots, and hyphens. Each pattern still requires a real path segment after
# the home marker, which excludes template placeholders on its own: `<name>`
# cannot match the class because `<`/`>` aren't in it, `C:\path\to\...` never
# reaches the `C:\Users\` pattern at all, and `$HOME` is not a literal path.
